<p> <em>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace<em/> (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852), 
 born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer
chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.
  Because of this, she is often described as the world's first computer programmer. </p>
